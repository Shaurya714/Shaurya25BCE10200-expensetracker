Problem Statement-
Managing daily expenses becomes difficult when there is no proper way to record and review them. People often forget how much they have spent or which category is consuming most of their money. Without a simple tracking system, maintaining financial awareness becomes challenging. This project solves this by providing an easy method to add expenses, check averages, and visualize spending patterns.



Scope of the Project-
The project focuses on creating a small, menu-driven expense tracker that works entirely in the terminal. 
It supports adding expenses, viewing all entries together, calculating the average spending, and displaying a pie chart for category-wise distribution. 
The system is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy for beginners to use, without involving databases or file storage.

Target Users-
Students who want a simple way to monitor their day-to-day spending.
Individuals who prefer a lightweight tool instead of full budgeting apps.
Anyone who needs a quick and clear view of their expenses without complex features.

High-Level Features-
Add expense with date, amount, and category.
View all saved expenses in a clean table format.
Calculate the average spending using NumPy.
Display a pie chart showing category-wise distribution using Matplotlib.
Simple menu interface for smooth navigation.
