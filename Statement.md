Problem Statement-
Tracking everyday expenses becomes difficult when there is no simple system to record and review how money is being spent. 
Without a clear view of spending patterns, users often lose track of their total expenses and struggle to understand where most of their money is going. 
This project aims to provide a basic and easy way to log expenses, check averages, and visualize spending distribution.

Scope of the Project-
The project focuses on creating a small, menu-driven expense tracker that works entirely in the terminal. 
It supports adding expenses, viewing all entries together, calculating the average spending, and displaying a pie chart for category-wise distribution. 
The system is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy for beginners to use, without involving databases or file storage.

Target Users-
Students who want a simple way to monitor their day-to-day spending.
Individuals who prefer a lightweight tool instead of full budgeting apps.
Anyone who needs a quick and clear view of their expenses without complex features.

High-Level Features-
Add expense with date, amount, and category.
View all saved expenses in a clean table format.
Calculate the average spending using NumPy.
Display a pie chart showing category-wise distribution using Matplotlib.
Simple menu interface for smooth navigation.
